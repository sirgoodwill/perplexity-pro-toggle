# Perplexity Pro Toggle

## Summary
Automatically disables Perplexity’s Pro Search on page load to avoid wasting limited Pro queries on regular searches. 

## Description
If you keep accidentally using up your Pro queries on Perplexity.ai, this extension automatically disables Pro Search when the page loads.
It helps you save Pro searches for more important or intensive tasks.

That’s it — you can still enable Pro manually afterward, since the plugin only runs once on page load.

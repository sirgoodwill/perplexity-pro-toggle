# Perplexity Pro Toggle ‚Äì Firefox Extension

## Summary
Automatically disables Perplexity‚Äôs Pro Search on page load to avoid wasting limited Pro queries on regular searches.

## Description
This is a lightweight **Firefox-only extension** that helps you avoid burning through your limited Perplexity Pro queries by mistake.

If you often forget to toggle off Pro Search on [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/), this extension takes care of it for you ‚Äî automatically clicking the "disable Pro" button as soon as the page loads.

You can still turn Pro back on manually if needed ‚Äî the extension runs just once per page load and won‚Äôt interfere after that.

---

## Why this exists
I was annoyed by accidentally using up my Pro searches on casual lookups ‚Äî and I wanted to keep them for serious use.  
This plugin is my one-click fix.
